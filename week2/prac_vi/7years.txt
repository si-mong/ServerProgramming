I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month
Soon, I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold?
or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be 60 years old
Soon, I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold?
or will I have a lot of children who can hold  me?
Soon, I'll be 60 years old
Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
"Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely"
Once, I was seven years old
Once, I was seven years old
